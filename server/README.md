# server

The server in this project is quite contrived (as is the project itself). This
is intentional. The goal of this project is to show you an example of how you
might configure a typical client-side application for testing. The server aspect
of a client-side application varies widely from app to app, so keeping it as
simple as possible is an effort to avoid distracting you from implementation
details of this specific app and help you focus on what really matters for
configuring these tools.

Suffice it to say: When E2E testing an app with Cypress, you'll likely need to
start the backend server in addition to the frontend app. This project will
demonstrate how you might accomplish that, but the specific scripts you
run to do that could vary.
